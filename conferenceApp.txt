Today's exercise
Contoso's conference app is getting further enhancements
Team, today is LAB DAY again - time to get our hands dirty with code!
Today's challenge is to further enhance your Conference App.

Here are the user stories:
As a conference attendee, I want to be able to book a seat at a session. As an attendee, I want to know which sessions I booked 
a seat for.As an attendee, when the time of a session approaches, I want to receive a reminder e-mail telling me that 
I'm booked for that particular session.

Non functional requirements:
Use the latest version of Bootstrap.Make it easy to customize Bootstrap's colorsTo identify an attendee, you should generate 
a cookie persisted on the disk with a random number. If the cookie exists, it should always contain a random (and hopefully unique)identifier, identifying the attendee. 

If it does not exist, it should be created immediately.Data must be persisted in a 
database (preferably use SQL Databases - this is Azure's PaaS, aka managed, offering for SQL Server)Provide all the data 
(sessions, speakers, available seats etc.) via an APIBesides the web front-end project and the Web API project, 
have a worker  project (Console Projects are fine too) which checks which sessions are coming up in the next xÂ minutes. 

try {
    var storTest = window['localStorage'];
    storTest.setItem("", ".");
    storTest.removeItem("");
}
catch (e) { alert("Local Storage Not Available"); }
 
function RandomId(min, max) {
    return Math.floor(Math.random() * (max - min)) + min;
}
 
var ls;
ls = localStorage;
var newUser = true;
while (newUser) {
    var newId = RandomId(1, 1000000);
    if (ls.key(newId) == null) {
        newUser = false;
        ls.setItem(newId, "Username")
    }
}



For the sessions which are coming up, it sends a reminder e-mail to all the attendees registered for that session.
Applications (at least the web front-end and the web api) must run on App Services

I am of the opinion that the projects, as they were left off last week are in good working state and you can build on top of 
them the new capabilities. Effectively, I expect that you're updating your Session models to retain a list of attendees and 
update your services to work with a SQL-based database (rather than a JSON file).
For the Bootstrap requirement, I expect you install Bootstrap from a package management solution and compile Sass to CSS.
